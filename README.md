# Phishing-Bot
This project involves the creation of a sophisticated bot that is capable of executing phishing attacks through various techniques such as PDF manipulation, site cloning, and natural language processing. The bot is designed to search for PDF files that contain relevant keywords and then clone the websites contained within them. It also has the ability to replace legitimate hyperlinks with malicious ones, allowing it to redirect victims to fake websites or pages that are designed to steal sensitive information.

In addition, the bot utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to craft targeted email messages and attach phishing PDFs for distribution to interested parties. However, it is important to note that the code for sending emails has been excluded from the Github repository in order to prevent the bot from being used for harmful purposes.

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential power and dangers of using bots for phishing attacks, and highlights the importance of being vigilant and cautious when it comes to protecting personal and sensitive information online.
